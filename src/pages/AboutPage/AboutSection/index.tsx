              Hello everyone! My name is <span className="text-yellow">Nam Dao</span>
              <br/>
              I an currently a rising-senior at Drexel University, majoring in <span className="text-yellow">Computer Science</span> and minoring in <span className="text-yellow">Finance</span>.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I am familiar with various technology stacks, mostly sufficient in <span className="text-yellow">Backend</span> space. However, I could do <span className="text-yellow">Fullstack</span> {" "}
              as I also have good amount of knowledge in <span  className="text-yellow">Frontend</span> development as well.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              During my previous internships and personal projects, I have a chance to work with multiple development spaces. Most of my projects are related to <span className="text-yellow">Web applications</span>. I have little experience working with <span className="text-yellow">Mobile application</span>, yet I am eager to learn and I believe that I can use my knowledge in adjancent fields to pick up skillsets along the way!
