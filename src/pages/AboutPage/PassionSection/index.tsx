              <h3>Football ‚öΩÔ∏è!</h3>
              <br/>
              I have been a <span className="text-yellow">huge football fan</span> since I was 11 years old. I used to attend part-time Football Academic Club during my young ages and had
              amazing experiences at the Academic.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              However, I decided to quit because of the <span className="text-purple">limitation in physical body</span> as well as I wanted to concentrate more on my academic path.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Despite of the fact that I quit the Academic, I continue to play street football with my friends whenever I have time, participated in school football tournaments as well as 
              watching and analyzing football.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              My favorite foot ball team is <span className="text-yellow">F.C. Barcelona üá™üá∏</span> and of course, the Great Player of All-time - <span className="text-yellow">Lionel Messi üá¶üá∑</span> {" "}
              is my favorite player.
