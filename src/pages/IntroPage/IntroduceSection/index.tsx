            <h1>LET'S HEAR ABOUT <span className="text-purple">MY STORY</span></h1>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>
              My coding journey started when I entered my Senior year during High School <span className="text-purple">(2017)</span>. Originally, I declared {" "}
              <span className="text-purple">Data Science</span> as a major since it was a trending job at the time.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              First year of college has been essential to me, as it helped me to realize that I was going on the <span className="text-purple">wrong direction</span>.
              I didn't enjoy learning theories and statistics, was planning to <span className="text-purple">quit STEM</span> and work on Finance degree.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Lucky enough, before I quitted, I decided to attend <span className="text-purple">a hackathon</span> with my friends one last time just to grab free üçï and networking.
              It turned out to be an amazing opportunity for me to get my hands a little bit of programming. 
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Although we didn't want to win anything at the end, I was still enjoy our time working together to brainstorm and create something meaningful that helps
              solving real world problems.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              This experience ignited my passion towards programming in general, with the desire to craft software that have certain impact to the people
              and society, so I decided to pursue <span className="text-purple">Computer Science</span> üñ•Ô∏è for my career.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Since then, I have been through amazing journeys, gathering lots of experiences during the way and get a chance to meet more amazing people
              in the industry. I am positive about the future and looking forward to having more opportunities to grow and meeting more people!
