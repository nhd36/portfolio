        I was super grateful that I was able to be part of the team, participated in company's events, learned from my colleages of different 
        ways to solve the problem, and understood about different business context while working on developing the program.. Furthermore, the 
        most important take was that I learned about the company's missions, different leadershi principles for career growth, as well as 
        enjoying my time at the company's workspace. Three months at Amazon helps me learn a lot about the system, how use technical knowledge
        and apply into some of the marketing aspects.
